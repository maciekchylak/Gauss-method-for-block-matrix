Project made for Numerical Methods whole by myself.

It is launched by using gauss_plus_builder function, 
where you have to insert block matrix, meeting demandings written in Sprawozdanie file.

Sprawozdanie contains statement in Polish about using this function. Addictionaly, it contains tests of this function.
